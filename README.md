# Mike Care Builds - Frontend

This is the frontend application for Mike Care Builds, a mobile mental health and wellness app tailored for Kenyan users.

## How to Run the App Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/myk733/Mike-ment.git
    cd Mike-ment
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Build for production (optional, but good practice):**
    ```bash
    pnpm run build
    ```
    This will create a `dist` folder with the optimized production build.

## Deployment

This frontend application is designed to be served by the Mike Care Builds Flask backend. The Flask backend will serve the static files generated by the frontend build process.

To deploy the full application (frontend and backend) on a single server, please refer to the [Backend README](https://github.com/myk733/Mike-ment2/blob/master/README.md) for detailed instructions.

**Note:** This frontend is no longer intended for direct deployment to static hosting services like GitHub Pages, as it relies on the Flask backend for API communication and serving its static assets.
